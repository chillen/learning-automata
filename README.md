# learning-automata
The code for my learning automata assignment. Tests Tsettlin, Krylov, and L_{RI} schemes. 

# Running

There are no special dependencies! Running `assignment.py` will output a bunch of results as well as save them to `results/Question#.csv`. The real automata code is in `vssa.py` and `fssa.py`. Assignment specific stuff is just sloppy binary searches and running simulations under multiple parameters.
