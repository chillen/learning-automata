# learning-automata
The code for my learning automata assignment. Tests Tsettlin, Krylov, and L_RI schemes. This repo is for grading purposes and a cleaner version will be going up soon I hope! :)

# Removing Soon

This was just whipped up quickly for the assignment to help get a better understanding of the automata. After getting to hack away at them and understanding much more after doing it, I'm hoping to make a much nicer repo later. I can't do it here, since it is linked to the assignment submission, but hopefully another repo will come soon which has some more thought put into it.
